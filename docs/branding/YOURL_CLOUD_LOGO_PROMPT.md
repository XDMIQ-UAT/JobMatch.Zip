Use this prompt with DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, or other AI image generators.

---

### Primary Prompt

```
Create a modern, minimalist logo for "yourl.cloud" - a cloud-based URL shortening service. 

Design Requirements:
- Incorporate a stylized cloud icon that feels both playful and professional
- Integrate subtle link/chain imagery or URL elements
- Color palette: Primary blues (#2563EB, #3B82F6) with cloud white (#F8FAFC) and accent purple (#8B5CF6)
- Clean, geometric shapes with soft, friendly curves
- Should work in monochrome, reversed, and full color
- Scalable from 16x16px favicon to billboard size

Style Guidelines:
- Modern tech startup aesthetic (think Vercel, Linear, Stripe)
- Slightly whimsical but maintains corporate credibility
- Clever visual wordplay (cloud + URL concepts)
- Negative space utilization for hidden meanings
- Sans-serif typography, medium weight, slightly rounded

Tone: Approachable yet trustworthy - fun enough for a startup culture deck, professional enough for enterprise sales materials.

Format: Vector-style illustration, flat design, single-color or 2-3 color maximum, transparent background.
```

## Alternative Variations

### Option 1: Wordmark Focus
```
Design a wordmark logo for "yourl.cloud" where the letters cleverly form or contain cloud shapes. The 'o' in "yourl" could be a minimalist cloud icon. Use a friendly sans-serif font with slightly rounded corners. Color: gradient from deep blue (#2563EB) to light blue (#3B82F6). Style: Modern SaaS company logo, clean and memorable.
```

### Option 2: Icon + Text
```
Create a logo combining a simple cloud icon with "yourl.cloud" text. The cloud should have 2-3 gentle curves suggesting connectivity or links. Place icon to the left of text. Font: Modern geometric sans-serif (similar to Inter or DM Sans). Colors: Blue cloud (#3B82F6) with dark gray text (#1F2937). Style: Professional tech startup, minimal but distinctive.
```

### Option 3: Abstract Symbol
```
Design an abstract logomark combining concepts of "cloud" and "URL shortening" using basic geometric shapes. Think: a cloud made of connected nodes/dots, or chain links forming a cloud silhouette. Monochromatic blue (#2563EB), highly simplified, works as app icon. Inspiration: Dropbox, Airtable, Notion - clean, iconic, instantly recognizable.
```

### Option 4: Playful Character
```
Create a friendly, minimalist cloud mascot character for "yourl.cloud". The cloud has simple dot eyes and a subtle smile, holding or made of link chains. Cartoon style but corporate-appropriate (like Mailchimp's Freddie or GitHub's Octocat). Primary color: bright blue (#3B82F6), secondary: white and light purple. Should feel welcoming but professional enough for B2B materials.
```

## Quick Tips for Best Results

3. **Keep it simple**: Less is more for logos
4. **Think black & white first**: If it doesn't work in monochrome, it won't work
5. **Test with real users**: Show it to people outside your team
6. **Consider animation**: How would it animate on load/hover?
