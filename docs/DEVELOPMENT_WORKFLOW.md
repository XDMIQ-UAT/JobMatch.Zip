# Development Workflow

## Primary Development Tools

This project is built using **interactive coding tools** for business-side development:

1. **Warp** - Terminal and shell interactions
2. **Claude Code** - AI-assisted coding with optimized prompts
3. **Cursor** - Interactive IDE for business logic development

## Development Philosophy

- **Business-side coding**: Focus on rapid iteration and business logic
- **Interactive development**: Use AI assistance for faster development cycles
- **Prompt optimization**: Leverage Claude Code hooks for better AI assistance

## Claude Code Integration

### Hooks Configuration

Claude Code hooks are configured to optimize prompt architecture for:
- Code generation patterns
- API endpoint creation
- Database schema changes
- Frontend component development
- Testing and debugging

### Prompt Optimization Strategy

1. **Context-Aware Prompts**: Hooks provide project context automatically
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Learn from existing code patterns
3. **Consistency**: Maintain coding standards across the project
4. **Business Logic Focus**: Prioritize business requirements over technical complexity

## Workflow

### Starting Development

1. Open project in **Cursor** for IDE features
2. Use **Warp** terminal for commands and operations
3. Leverage **Claude Code** hooks for AI assistance

### Code Generation

- Use Claude Code hooks for:
  - API endpoint scaffolding
  - Database model creation
  - Frontend component generation
  - Test writing

### Interactive Development

- Real-time AI assistance in Cursor
- Terminal operations in Warp
- Prompt optimization through Claude Code hooks

## Best Practices

1. **Use hooks before coding**: Let Claude Code understand context
2. **Iterate interactively**: Use Cursor's AI features for rapid changes
3. **Terminal operations**: Use Warp for all command-line work
4. **Prompt clarity**: Be specific about business requirements
