# Human-in-the-Loop Architecture

## Core Principle

**People enabled with machines > pure automation**

Every AI decision has human oversight/validation. The system requires at least one human, and can scale to many humans.

## Implementation

### Matching Engine
- AI generates initial matches
- Human reviewers validate match quality
- System learns from human feedback
- More humans = better matches

### Capability Assessment
- AI evaluates capabilities
- Humans verify edge cases
- Human reviewers handle ambiguous assessments

### Articulation Assistant
- AI suggests language
- Humans refine suggestions
- Version control for iterations

### Moderation
- AI flags content
- Humans make final decisions
- Human oversight scales with content volume

## Scaling

The system is designed so that:
- At least one human is always involved
- More humans improve outcomes, not just capacity
- Human oversight quality improves as system scales
