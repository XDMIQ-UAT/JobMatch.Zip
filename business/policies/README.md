# Policies - Privacy and Data Boundaries

This folder contains privacy policies and data boundary definitions for the platform.

## Purpose

Define platform policies:
- **Privacy Policies**: How user data (including anonymous data) is handled
- **Data Boundaries**: What data can and cannot be stored, processed, or shared
- **Anonymous-First Policies**: Rules for maintaining anonymous-first architecture
- **Compliance**: Policies aligned with privacy regulations

## Key Principles

- **Anonymous-First**: Default to anonymous operations
- **Zero-Knowledge**: Platform cannot reverse-engineer identity
- **User Control**: Users control their data and identity linking
- **Privacy by Design**: Privacy built into platform architecture
- **Transparency**: Clear policies communicated to users
